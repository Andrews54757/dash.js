The version 5 branch (`v5.0.0`) has been merged to the `development`branch. Consequently, the focus is now set
completely on the work on version 5 of dash.js. We are aware that transitioning to a new major version of dash.js takes
time and careful testing. For that reason, we keep maintaining a `v4_main` and `v4_development` branch for important
bugfixes and releases of version 4. Here are all the important links:

* Hosted `development` branch: [V5 Nightly](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/nightly/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html)
* Hosted `main` branch (v5 after the official release): [V5 Latest](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/latest/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html)
* Hosted `v4_development` branch: [V4 Nightly](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/v4_development/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html)
* Hosted `v4_main` branch: [V4 Latest](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/v4_latest/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html)
